Signs of a slab leak can include:</p><p id="""">-Wet areas on the floor</p><p id="""">-A sudden increase in your water bill</p><p id="""">-The sound of water running, even when all taps and appliances are turned off</p><p id="""">-The smell of rotten eggs (due to the high concentration of hydrogen sulfide gas in water that has been compromised by a leak)</p><p id="""">If you're seeing any of these signs, don't hesitate to call a professional. They will be able to test for leaks and, if necessary, repair them.</p><h4 id="""">Professional Slab Leak Detection Methods</h4><p id="""">There are a few different methods that professionals use to detect slab leaks. One is to use ground-penetrating radar (GPR), which can detect changes in the soil composition that could be caused by a leak. This method is especially useful for detecting leaks that are hidden beneath concrete or other hard surfaces.</p><p id="""">Another common method is to use a water meter, which can help identify areas of high water consumption that could be caused by a leak. And finally, some professionals will use thermal imaging to detect leaks. Thermal imaging uses infrared radiation to identify temperature differences, which can be an indication of a leak.</p><h4 id="""">Benefits of an Electronic Slab Leak Detector</h4><p id="""">One of the most reliable methods for detecting a slab leak is to use an electronic slab leak detector. These devices are designed for the specific purpose of detecting leaks in the slab foundation and can be used without having to break through other areas of the building.</p><p id="""">An electronic slab leak detector works by using an array of sensors to detect and pinpoint even the smallest of leaks in a concrete slab. The benefit is that it can detect any kind of fluid, including both water and gas, and also pinpoint exactly where it’s coming from beneath the slab.</p><p id="""">Additionally, these detectors come with a built-in tracing system, which allows you to monitor your detection results over time to ensure accuracy. This makes it easier to accurately diagnose any changes in water pressure or flow within the pipes, which can help you pinpoint where exactly a leak may be located and how severe it is.</p><h4 id="""">The Advantages of Hydrostatic Pressure Testing</h4><p id="""">Hydrostatic pressure testing is a great way to detect a slab leak because it can identify even small leaks that aren’t visible by normal means. This involves pressurizing the plumbing system while it’s full of water, then slowly releasing the pressure and checking for drops in pressure that indicate a leak.</p><p id="""">The advantages of hydrostatic pressure testing include that it’s non-invasive; it’s fast and efficient, meaning you can get your slab leak diagnosis in no time; it’s relatively inexpensive; and most importantly, it’s accurate. This type of testing also doesn’t require digging or holes in your slab, which is helpful if you want to keep your property intact.</p><p id="""">So as you can tell, if you suspect there may be a slab leak at your property, hydrostatic pressure testing is one of the best ways to get an accurate diagnosis—and start getting repairs on the way!</p><h4 id="""">Preventive Measures to Avoid a Slab Leak</h4><p id="""">You can take some preventive measures to keep a slab leak from happening in the first place. First, check to make sure your plumbing system is properly installed and that there aren’t any loose or corroded pipes. If you have old plumbing, consider replacing it before a potential slab leak develops.</p><p id="""">Another thing you can do is to check your water pressure on a regular basis. If the water pressure is too high, the pipes may become damaged, so make sure it's not over 80 psi. You'll also want to make sure that any outdoor lines are properly insulated against freezing temperatures during the winter months.</p><p id="""">Finally, if you're doing any remodeling or construction work on your home, be sure to seek professional advice about re-routing and/or relocating your pipes away from the foundation of your home. This should help reduce the chance of a slab leak developing in the future.</p><h4 id="""">Conclusion</h4><p id="""">If you're ever in doubt, it's always best to call in a professional to take a look and diagnose the extent of the problem. With the help of this guide, you're now armed with the knowledge to detect a slab leak yourself and take the necessary steps to fix it.</p>",,,Slab Leak Diagnostic and Tips | Brandenburg Plumbing

Read our strategies on how to diagnose and fix high water pressure.","<p id="""">Low water pressure can pose an inconvenience, as no one wants to spend an eternity rinsing shampoo from their hair. However, it's important to note that high water pressure can present an even more significant issue than its low counterpart.</p><p id="""">Excessive water pressure can lead to plumbing problems and accelerate the wear and tear of costly appliances. To gain a better understanding of the complications stemming from high water pressure and discover ways to maintain a safe level in your home, refer to this comprehensive guide. It aims to provide valuable insights and practical solutions to help you effectively manage your water pressure.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">What Happens If My Water Pressure is Too High?</strong></h4><p id="""">High water pressure puts excess strain on your plumbing system, including your pipes, seals and appliances that use water. As high volumes of water are forced through, the parts that make up your plumbing system are stressed by the pressure which can lead to a variety of problems.</p><p id="""">Over time, high water pressure wears on your plumbing system and leads to:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Leaking Pipes:</strong> Excessive water pressure exerts continuous force on your pipes, gradually causing them to deteriorate and fail to contain the water. This can result in the development of pinhole leaks, leading to water damage in hard-to-reach areas of your home, such as behind walls. </li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Broken Seals:</strong> High water pressure can also contribute to the breakdown or accelerated wear of seals around pipe ends. Similar to leaking pipes, broken seals can cause water damage within your home. In some cases, a sudden surge in pressure can lead to a burst pipe, causing water to flow throughout your entire home.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Worn Appliances:</strong> Appliances that rely on water, such as dishwashers, washing machines, or water heaters, are designed to operate under specific water pressure conditions. When the water pressure exceeds the recommended level, the hoses and internal components of these appliances may experience excessive wear or even complete failure. This not only increases the risk of premature appliance failure but may also void the warranty.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">High Water Bills:</strong> Excessive water pressure can result in more than just physical problems. It can also lead to higher water bills. If you are looking to save money on utilities, it's important to consider that high water pressure could be contributing to your increased costs.</li></ul><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">How Do I Know if I Have High Water Pressure?</strong></h4><p id="""">The optimal water pressure range for residential homes typically falls between 40 and 80 pounds per square inch (psi). To determine if your water pressure is high, you can employ a water pressure gauge—a cost-effective tool readily available at hardware stores for under $20.</p><p id="""">To utilize the pressure gauge effectively, attach it to a faucet while ensuring the water is turned off. Verify that the gauge registers 0 psi before turning on the water. Once the water is running, observe the gauge's needle to ascertain the pressure reading. If the needle exceeds 80 psi, it may be necessary to reduce your water pressure.</p><p id="""">While a water pressure gauge offers a reliable measurement, there are also alternative, though less scientific, methods to identify high water pressure. Indicators of elevated water pressure include:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Increased Water Bills:</strong> If you notice a significant rise in your water bills, it could indicate excessive water consumption. This may signal that the water pressure in your plumbing system is too high.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Noisy Pipes:</strong> When water flows at high pressure through your pipes, it can create turbulence and result in pipes vibrating, clanging, or shaking. This phenomenon occurs when water rebounds off the pipe walls, causing these disruptive noises.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Loud Appliances:</strong> Excessive noise from washing machines and dishwashers during water flow may indicate elevated water pressure. This can cause your appliances to work harder to regulate water movement through the hoses, resulting in the audible noise you hear. Understanding this correlation can help you identify and address potential issues with your water supply system.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Insufficient Hot Water</strong>: Have you noticed that your hot water supply depletes quickly, leaving you with only a few minutes of hot water? This issue could indicate high water pressure. The increased pressure results in a higher volume of water flowing through your faucet or showerhead in a shorter duration. Understanding this connection can help you address the issue effectively.</li></ul><p id="""">Fixing high water pressure is crucial for preventing water damage and maintaining the longevity of your plumbing and appliances. Most modern homes are equipped with a water pressure regulator to monitor and control water pressure levels. If you're experiencing persistently high water pressure, it's recommended to check your regulator. Adjusting it may help lower the water pressure, but in some cases, replacing it with a new one might be necessary. </p><p id="""">For older homes that lack a water pressure regulator, it's advisable to consider having one installed, which typically requires the assistance of a professional plumber. By addressing high water pressure, you can effectively mitigate the risk of major plumbing issues caused by water leaks or burst pipes. </p><p id="""">‍</p>",,,High Water Pressure in Your Home Can Cause Expensive Problems

Find out how to use it from our experts.","<h4 id="""">What Is a Plumbing Snake?</h4><p id="""">A plumbing snake, also known as a drain auger, is an instrument that is inserted into a clogged drain to clear it. It is a coiled metal wire that is pushed and turned down the drain to break up the clog and remove it.</p><p id="""">Snakes come in different sizes, and you will need to select the right one for your drain. You can buy them at most hardware stores, or you can rent them from your local plumber.</p><h4 id="""">How to Properly Use a Plumbing Snake</h4><p id="""">You should now have a good understanding of how to properly use a plumbing snake. By following these simple steps, you can clear clogged drains like a pro.</p><p id="""">Remember to always be cautious when using a plumbing snake. Safety should always be your number one priority. If you are not comfortable using a plumbing snake, or if you feel like the clog is too deep for you to handle, please call a professional plumber.</p><h4 id="""">Choosing the Right Plumbing Snake for the Job</h4><p id="""">When it comes to clearing clogged drains, there's no one-size-fits-all snake. You need to choose the right plumbing snake for the job, and that depends on the type of clog you're dealing with.</p><p id="""">For instance, if you're dealing with a hair clog, you'll need a slim snake that can fit down the drainpipe. But if you're dealing with a clog caused by something like grease or toilet paper, you'll need a heavy-duty snake that can break up the obstruction.</p><p id="""">Your plumbing snake dealer will be able to help you choose the right snake for the job, so don't be afraid to ask for their advice. They should be able to recommend the right snake for your needs, and they'll also be able to show you how to use it properly.</p><h4 id="""">Step-by-Step Guide to Using a Plumbing Snake</h4><p id="""">Using a plumbing snake isn't hard, but it does require a bit of patience. Here's how to use one correctly:</p><p id="""">1. Remove any debris from the top of the pipe that might be clogging it. This may require unscrewing the sink/toilet drain first.</p><p id="""">2. Insert the plumbing snake into the pipe at an angle so that you can push it downwards further into the drain pipe until you reach your desired depth.</p><p id="""">3. Slowly rotate the knob on the handle of the snake in order to pull back any material that might be blocking your drain (e.g., hair, soap scum, etc.).</p><p id="""">4. Keep rotating and pulling back until you feel like nothing else is blocking your drain and then remove it from the pipe slowly and carefully until all coils are out.</p><p id="""">5, Run some hot water down the drain or flush your toilet to make sure that everything has been cleared properly and all debris has been removed!</p><h4 id="""">Tips and Safety Measures When Using a Plumbing Snake</h4><p id="""">When using a plumbing snake, you should take some basic safety measures. First, make sure the plumbing snake is in good condition and has no frayed wires or exposed electrical outlets. Wear protective clothing, including gloves and goggles. When you’re working with power tools in tight spaces, always have a partner nearby to keep an eye on you.</p><p id="""">Before inserting the plumbing snake into the drain, make sure that the area is free from any debris or foreign objects that could be caught up in the machine or snag your clothing. Also, remember to snake from end to end rather than going around in circles–you don’t want to damage any of your underground pipes! Finally, be sure to unplug the plumbing snake after every use and store it appropriately.</p><h4 id="""">FAQs About Using a Plumbing Snake</h4><p id="""">Using a plumbing snake is a great way to help clear out clogged drains, but you might still have some questions. Here are some of the most common questions I hear related to using a plumbing snake:</p><p id="""">- Is it safe to use a plumbing snake? Yes! As long as you use the right technique and safety measures, using a plumbing snake is perfectly safe.</p><p id="""">- How often should I use my plumbing snake? You should only use your plumbing snake when needed and don’t overuse it.</p><p id="""">- Will using a plumbing snake damage my pipes? With proper technique and experience, using a plumbing snake shouldn’t damage your pipes. However, if you’re not confident in your skills, it may be best to call in an experienced plumber.</p>",,,How to Use a Plumbing Snake | Brandenburg Plumbing

","<h4 id="""">Inspect and Maintain Your Plumbing Regularly</h4><p id="""">One of the best ways to save money on your plumbing is to inspect and maintain it regularly. This means checking for leaks, clogs, and other issues that can cause problems down the road.</p><p id="""">It's also a good idea to take some preventative measures to avoid plumbing problems in the first place. For example, you can run water from your faucet for a few minutes each day to help keep your pipes clear. You can also avoid putting things like coffee grounds and eggshells down the drain, as these can cause clogs.</p><p id="""">By following these tips, you can help keep your plumbing running smoothly—and save yourself a lot of money in the process.</p><h4 id="""">Focus on Water-Saving Fixtures in Your Home</h4><p id="""">One of the simplest ways to reduce your water bill is to install water-saving fixtures in your home. Low-flow showerheads, faucets and toilets can save you hundreds of gallons of water each month, without compromising on performance.</p><p id="""">Consider replacing your old fixtures with newer, more efficient models. You may even be able to find tax incentives or rebates from your local government or water utility company. And remember to properly maintain your plumbing fixtures - cleaning them regularly and replacing washers and O-rings as needed - to ensure optimal performance and savings.</p><h4 id="""">Invest in Preventative Maintenance for Major Appliances</h4><p id="""">One of the smartest ways to save money on your plumbing bills is to invest in preventative maintenance for your major appliances. This means scheduled cleanings and tune-ups that can help avoid costly repairs in the future.</p><p id="""">Many plumbers offer routine maintenance plans that can be tailored to your needs. For example, you may want a plan that includes quarterly cleanings and inspections, or you may prefer a plan that covers annual maintenance.</p><p id="""">No matter what plan you choose, it's important to stick with it. That way, you'll avoid any nasty surprises down the road and keep your appliances running smoothly—and your wallet a little bit fatter.</p><h4 id="""">Install a Water Shutoff System</h4><p id="""">Installing a water shutoff system is one of the smartest plumbing tips for saving money. A water shutoff system will shut off your water supply when it detects a leak or burst pipe. This means that you won’t have to worry about sky-high water bills caused by undetected leaks and can help you from costly repairs.</p><p id="""">The best part is that water shutoff systems are incredibly easy to install, so you don’t even have to hire a professional plumber. They come in different sizes, shapes, and designs, so it's important to do some research and find the right one for your home. Some systems even come with advanced features like remote control, automatic timers, and text notifications, so make sure to read up on all the options before making your decision.</p><h4 id="""">Take Care of Minor Plumbing Issues Immediately</h4><p id="""">It can be tempting to ignore small plumbing issues, but this can often lead to bigger, more expensive problems down the line. It's always a smart idea to take care of minor plumbing issues as soon as you can.</p><p id="""">For instance, dripping taps may seem like an annoyance at first, but they can add up to big water bills over time. If you spot any leaks or drips, be sure to call your local plumber right away.</p><p id="""">The same goes for clogged drains. While store-bought chemical drain cleaners might seem like a cheap and easy fix, they're rarely effective and can even corrode your pipes over time. Instead, hire a plumber who can get the job done quickly and safely without further damaging your pipes or wallet.</p><h4 id="""">Know When to Call a Professional Plumber</h4><p id="""">Knowing when it's time to call a professional plumber is a smart way to save money in the long run. Your plumbing system is complicated and repairs can be expensive if done incorrectly.</p><p id="""">Some of the signs that suggest you should contact your local plumber include water leaking from the pipes, hearing strange noises coming from your pipes, or being unable to locate the source of a clog. Additionally, if you keep having recurring clogs and slow drainage it may be time to have your plumbing inspected by an expert.</p><p id="""">Also, if it's been more than five years since you last had your plumbing inspected, it's time to schedule an appointment with a professional. It's easy to think that because everything seems fine, you don't need to get it checked out but having an expert take a look will not only give you peace of mind but can also help identify potential problems that may arise in the future which could end up costing you more money.</p>",,,Saving Money with Plumbing | Brandenburg Plumbing

Whether you're looking to cut costs or just be more water-conscious, there are simple ways to lower your water bill without sacrificing comfort. Here are some of the best ways to save money on water usage in your home.</p><h4 id="""">1. Fix Leaks ASAP</h4><p id="""">A small leak might not seem like a big deal, but even a slow-dripping faucet can waste <strong id="""">hundreds of gallons</strong> of water per year. If you notice a leak under your sink, in your toilet, or anywhere else, get it fixed right away. A running toilet can waste up to <strong id="""">200 gallons of water per day</strong>—that’s money down the drain!</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Tip:</strong> You can check for leaks by turning off all water sources and watching your water meter. If it’s still moving, you’ve got a leak.</p><h4 id="""">2. Upgrade to Water-Efficient Fixtures</h4><p id="""">Switching to <strong id="""">low-flow toilets, faucets, and showerheads</strong> can cut your water usage significantly. These modern fixtures use less water while maintaining good pressure, so you won’t even notice the difference—except on your bill.</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Low-flow toilets</strong> use about <strong id="""">1.28 gallons per flush</strong> instead of 3-5 gallons.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Water-saving showerheads</strong> can cut usage by <strong id="""">40% or more</strong> without reducing water pressure.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Faucet aerators</strong> are cheap and can reduce water flow while still keeping strong pressure for washing hands or dishes.</li></ul><h4 id="""">3. Be Smart About Laundry and Dishes</h4><p id="""">Your washing machine and dishwasher can be major water users, but a few small changes can make a big difference.</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Only run full loads</strong> of laundry and dishes to maximize efficiency.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Use the right cycle.</strong> Many washers have eco-friendly settings that use less water.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Skip the extra rinse cycle</strong> unless it's necessary.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Consider upgrading to ENERGY STAR® appliances</strong>, which use less water and energy.</li></ul><h4 id="""">4. Cut Down on Outdoor Water Usage</h4><p id="""">In Texas, keeping your lawn green can be a big part of your water bill. Here’s how to reduce outdoor water waste:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Water early in the morning or late at night</strong> to prevent evaporation.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Use a soaker hose or drip irrigation</strong> instead of sprinklers to target roots directly.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Choose drought-resistant plants</strong> that require less watering.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Adjust your sprinklers</strong> so they’re watering your lawn, not your driveway or sidewalk.</li></ul><h4 id="""">5. Upgrade to a Hybrid Heat Pump Water Heater</h4><p id="""">A standard water heater can be a major energy and water expense. If you want to <strong id="""">cut costs on hot water</strong>, consider upgrading to a <strong id="""">hybrid heat pump water heater</strong>. These models use significantly less energy, which translates to lower utility bills. Plus, they often qualify for <strong id="""">rebates and tax incentives</strong>, which means you could save even more!</p><h4 id="""">6. Turn Off Water When Not in Use</h4><p id="""">It sounds simple, but small habits can lead to big savings:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth</strong> (saves about 4 gallons per minute).</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Take shorter showers</strong>—cutting your shower by <strong id="""">2 minutes</strong> can save <strong id="""">hundreds of gallons per month</strong>.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Fill a bowl with water when washing dishes</strong> instead of running the tap.</li></ul><h4 id="""">7. Consider a Water Softener or Filtration System</h4><p id="""">Hard water can cause mineral buildup in your pipes and appliances, making them less efficient over time. A <strong id="""">water softener or filtration system</strong> can help appliances work better, last longer, and even reduce the amount of soap and detergent needed—saving you money on products and water.</p><h4 id="""">8. Know Your Water Usage</h4><p id="""">Most water bills provide a breakdown of your water usage. Take a look at your bill to see if there are any unusual spikes. If your water usage is unexpectedly high, there may be a leak or another issue that needs attention.</p><h4 id="""">Final Thoughts</h4><p id="""">Saving money on your water bill doesn’t require huge lifestyle changes—just a few small adjustments can make a big difference. By fixing leaks, upgrading fixtures, using water-efficient appliances, and being mindful of your habits, you can cut down on wasted water and put more money back in your pocket.</p><p id="""">If you suspect a leak or need help upgrading to water-efficient plumbing, <strong id="""">Brandenburg Plumbing is here to help</strong>!

But, we are also absolutely committed to helping homeowners as much as we humanely can, so today we’d like to talk about an all too common problem: plumbing scams.</p><p id="""">Most, if not all, plumbing scams are centered around unnecessary replacements, especially sewer lines and water heaters.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Main sewer line replacements</strong></h4><p id="""">The most common scam is using drain cleaning to sell unnecessary main sewer line replacements, from anywhere from $4,000-$15,000. They scam typically goes like this:</p><ol id=""""><li id="""">The company advertises a very low price for the drain cleaning, often $99 or less, along with 24 hour service. This gets the plumber/salesman in the door.</li><li id="""">A technician runs a snake down a sewer line and encounters a blockage. Sometimes, to ensure the blockage seems severe, the plumber will use no blades on the sewer machine, or sometimes they use smaller blades that can’t clear the blockage. The technician will then use this inability to clear the line to sell a full line replacement. If your sewer line is made from schedule 40 PVC, and most are, there are very few instances where a full replacement would be warranted.</li><li id="""">Some plumbers use the camera to justify the enormous replacement cost. They may find a small belly — a dip in the line where grease and other clogging elements might accumulate, or roots and insist this means that the entire line must be replaced. The most grievous example of the camera scam is when the plumber sends a video of an entirely different sewer line, pretending it’s yours, in order to sell the replacement.</li><li id="""">Finally, they may poke a small hole in the clog, which will fully reform within a couple of days as more grease and other debris attaches to the clog. Then, when they return a few days later to address the clog again, the plumber will claim that to truly fix the problem they must replace the whole line. It could be all the line needed was a hydro jetter instead of a snake.</li></ol><p id="""">Now, we aren’t claiming that it’s never the case that sewer lines need replacing. &nbsp;Especially around older homes, or where roots are extremely prevalent, that may be the best course of action. But, be wary of plumbers who jump immediately to the most expensive option. Roots can often be mitigated with annual drain clearing and root killer, though a repair of the spot with roots growing in is definitely the best option so the chance of sewer backing up into your home is mitigated. Bellies in the line can be big issues or minor. It takes an experienced plumber with your best interests at heart to know the difference.</p><p id="""">Note: we do not recommend renting a sewer machine and trying to do it yourself. They are dangerous pieces of equipment that can easily take off a finger or worse, and should only be used by licensed plumbers. We always err on the side of caution when telling customers what they may be capable of handling themselves because while there are truly capable people out there, there are some that struggle to operate a toaster without the instructions, and there is no way for us to discern the level of capability of any individual.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Water Heater Replacements</strong></h4><p id="""">This scam is a little simpler. It may be a simple heating element is out, or a thermostat needs to be replaced. Sometimes the problem is with the electrical system, like a breaker is failing and is not sending the correct voltage to the water heater. These are all testable conditions and whether it is from a lack of knowledge or a thirst for the larger sale it ends with the same result for the customer, more money out of pocket for an unnecessary upgrade.</p><p id="""">This one comes with a large caveat though: the warranties. If your warranty on your water heater has run out, and you are experiencing leaks or lack of hot water, it’s often less expensive, not to mention safer, over the long run to replace the water heater. Again, a licensed professional who you trust can explain their reasoning here thoroughly and simply.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Why do plumbers scam?</strong></h4><p id="""">The obvious reason is money, but it’s a bit more complex. One, replacements often mean that the plumber won’t need to worry about their proposed solution not working. A brand new sewer line or water heater likely won’t present further issues and additional costs down the line. Replacement can at times be a legitimately less risky offer, especially for the less experienced that do not know how to test and diagnose a specific issue. So, a replacement will guarantee all of their bases are covered </p><p id="""">But, the main issue is commission pay. If a plumber makes more by selling more, they will almost inevitably bend the truth to make more money. Many are so heavily commission based that the &nbsp;technicians have little choice but to recommend unnecessary work. If they don’t, their pay plummets and they can no longer sustain themselves and their families.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">How do I avoid being scammed?</strong></h4><p id="""">First, think local. The national chains often grew to the size they are by pushing the commission based model, which inevitably leads to some less than scrupulous practices.</p><p id="""">Second, ask for referrals. Oftentimes the plumber that helped your friend or family will be far more honest and fair than national companies with big advertising campaigns focused only on maximizing the short-term dollar from their customers. </p><p id="""">Finally, if a bid seems off to you, get another one! We’d be happy to provide a free competitive quote with a licensed plumber.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Takeaways</strong></p><p id="""">We aren’t saying that sewer lines or water heaters never need replacing — they often do. Large amounts of scale from hard water making a fix impossible or a fixture or appliance nearing the end of its life could easily mean a replacement is warranted. But many times a less costly repair would work just as well. Finding a trustworthy plumber who will be honest and explain their reasoning is an essential part of owning a home or business. </p>",,,How to Spot the Most Common Plumbing Scams

But have you given any thought to your plumbing?</p><p id="""">Just like your body, your plumbing needs a little TLC in order to stay healthy during the winter months. Follow these simple tips, and you can rest easy knowing that your home's plumbing is well taken care of.</p><h4 id="""">Why Winterizing Your Plumbing Is Important</h4><p id="""">Pipes that aren't properly winterized can burst during cold weather, leading to expensive repairs and a lot of headache. You don't want to be faced with a broken pipe in the dead of winter, so it's important to take some preventative steps now.</p><p id="""">Here are a few tips on how to winterize your home's plumbing:</p><p id="""">1.

Drain all the water from your pipes. You can do this by turning on all the faucets in your home and letting them run until the water is no longer flowing.</p><p id="""">3. Disconnect any hoses from your outdoor taps and store them inside. If you don't do this, water can still flow through the hoses and into your home while they're disconnected, leading to freezing and even more damage.</p><p id="""">4. Inspect your pipes and insulation for any damage or wear and tear. If you find any problems, have them fixed before the cold weather hits.</p><h4 id="""">Tips for Keeping Pipes From Freezing</h4><p id="""">If you want to keep your home's plumbing from freezing this winter, start by following these tips:</p><p id="""">1. Open the cabinet doors under your kitchen and bathroom sinks to allow warm air to circulate around the pipes.</p><p id="""">2. Let the water trickle from your faucets (the colder it is outside, the more water you'll need to trickle).</p><p id="""">3. If you're going to be away from home for an extended period of time, turn off the water supply at the main valve.</p><p id="""">4. If you experience a plumbing emergency while you're away, have a friend or neighbor check on your property and call a plumber if necessary.</p><h4 id="""">Steps for Winterizing Exterior Faucets and Hoses</h4><p id="""">You should disconnect all exterior hoses and faucets. This includes the garden hose, any hoses that are attached to the outside of your house, and the spigots that are used to water your lawn. Shut off the water valve that supplies these faucets, and then open the taps to release any pressure that may be in the lines.</p><p id="""">If you have a garden hose that doesn't have a shut-off valve, you can either coil it up and store it in a sheltered area, or you can fill it with water and freeze it. This will take care of the water in the hose and will also help to keep the hose from expanding and developing cracks when it freezes.</p><h4 id="""">How to Inspect and Seal Gaps Around Doors and Windows</h4><p id="""">If you haven't already, be sure to inspect the seal around your doors and windows. If you feel a draft coming through, then you know there's likely air infiltration occurring. This can actually lead to frozen pipes as the warm air infiltrating your home is greatly reduced when temperatures drop below freezing.</p><p id="""">To address this issue, you should use caulk and expanding foam insulation to fill any gaps or cracks around the door frame or window frame. Be sure to apply the caulk or foam generously, so that it seals itself against the weather stripping and forms an air-tight barrier.</p><p id="""">You may also want to consider adding weather stripping around these areas as well, which will help prevent any air from getting in. You can get it pre-cut at most hardware stores so it fits perfectly around your doors and windows. In addition, make sure that you check for any tears or rips in your door and window screens each winter as well.</p><h4 id="""">Preparing Hot Water Pipes for Winter</h4><p id="""">Now let’s talk about the hot water pipes in your home. These need to be winterized too, as cold weather can cause pipes to crack or burst when water freezes inside them.</p><p id="""">The main way to winterize your hot water pipes is to make sure they are properly insulated with insulation tape or pre-slit foam wrap. This will retain heat and prevent freezing. You may also want to invest in an electric pipe heating cable, which is a great way to keep these pipes warm, as it acts like a low-voltage heater and wraps around the outside of the pipe.</p><p id="""">If you have an outdoor spigot, be sure to disconnect all hoses from it and store these away in the garage or basement. You want to make sure no remaining water can get frozen inside the spigot, which could cause damage. Finally, be sure to open any valves inside your house near exposed piping, allowing warmer air into these areas when possible.</p><h4 id="""">Preparing Water Heating Systems for Winter</h4><p id="""">Winterizing your home’s plumbing can also mean preparing your water heating systems for the cold temperatures. First, inspect the water heater for signs of rust and problems. If there are any issues, consider having a professional come out to take a look at it.</p><p id="""">Second, insulate the pipes leading into and out of the heater to prevent freezing or other issues that could occur due to extreme temperatures. Be sure to use high-grade insulation and follow the manufacturer's recommendations for proper installation.</p><p id="""">Lastly, check that your water heater is draining correctly—this will prevent any build-up of sediment or corrosion from occurring during the winter months. If there’s any clogs or blockages, be sure to contact a professional who can help clear it up before permanent damage happens. Taking these simple steps will help ensure your water heating system is ready for winter and all its weather-related challenges!</p>",,,Winterize Your Plumbing | Brandenburg Plumbing

Here is what you need to consider.,"<h4 id="""">What Are the Signs Your Water Heater Is About to Fail?</h4><p id="""">If you're not sure whether it's time to replace your water heater, here are some telltale signs that it might be time:</p><p id="""">-Your water heater is more than 10 years old. The average lifespan of a water heater is about 10 years, so if yours is older than that, it might be time for a replacement.</p><p id="""">-Your water heater is making strange noises. If it's been making strange noises for a while, that could be a sign that it's on the verge of failing.</p><p id="""">-Your water heater is leaking. A leaking water heater is an obvious sign that it's time for a replacement.</p><p id="""">-Your water heater isn't heating water as effectively as it used to. If your water heater isn't providing the same level of heat as it used to, it might be time for a replacement.</p><h4 id="""">How Much Does It Cost to Replace a Water Heater?</h4><p id="""">The cost of a water heater replacement can vary depending on the size and type of water heater you choose. However, the average price for a replacement water heater ranges from $600 to $1,500.</p><p id="""">If your water heater is more than 8 years old, it's likely time for a replacement. As your water heater gets older, it becomes less efficient and will cost more to operate. A new water heater will also come with updated safety features that can help avoid costly repairs down the road.</p><p id="""">If you're considering a water heater replacement, be sure to consult with a licensed plumber to get an accurate estimate for your specific needs.</p><h4 id="""">What Type of Water Heater Should You Choose?</h4><p id="""">Now that you know it might be time to replace your water heater, it's important to decide what type of water heater you want.</p><p id="""">There are two types of water heaters: tank and tankless. A tank water heater stores water in a tank and heats it up as it's needed. A tankless water heater doesn't store any water—it heats the water as it passes through the unit.</p><p id="""">Both types have their pros and cons, so you'll need to decide which one is best for you. If you're looking for fast, consistent heat, a tankless water heater is a good choice. But if you're worried about running out of hot water, a tank water heater might be a better option.</p><h4 id="""">What Are the Best Brands for Water Heaters?</h4><p id="""">When it comes to replacing your water heater, it’s important to consider the brand. You want to make sure that you're getting a reliable and efficient machine that will last for years. Luckily, there are several brands that excel in both.</p><p id="""">Two of the most popular brands are Rheem and A.O. Smith. Both offer a variety of water heaters with Energy Star-certified models, so you're guaranteed to find one with high energy efficiency ratings. Plus, Rheem has their line of Marathon models, which are constructed with non-metallic tanks so they won't corrode or develop leaks over time like other water heaters can.</p><p id="""">No matter which brand you decide on, be sure to read and compare all the specs before purchasing—like what type of warranties they offer and what size tank best suits your needs—so you can get the perfect fit for your home.</p><h4 id="""">How Do I Install a New Water Heater?</h4><p id="""">Now that you’ve decided the time is right to replace your old water heater, the next step is to determine how you’re going to do it. Fortunately, replacing a water heater isn’t that complicated and it typically doesn’t require extra repairs or pipes being moved around.</p><p id="""">The first thing you should do is take detailed measurements of your existing water heater so you know what size to buy. It's also a good idea to make sure the type of gas or electricity is compatible with your home.</p><p id="""">Next, purchase the new water heater and all the necessary accessories such as new hoses, pipes and venting parts. Make sure everything fits properly and then start the installation process. You may want to hire a professional for this step if you don't feel comfortable doing it on your own.</p><p id="""">Finally, once you've finished installing the new water heater and tested it out, turn off all power sources and dispose of your old water heater in an environmentally friendly manner.</p><h4 id="""">What Are the Energy Efficiency Standards for New Water Heaters?</h4><p id="""">Now, a quick overview of the energy efficiency standards for new water heaters. Remember, the older your water heater is, the less efficient it will be and therefore more expensive to operate.</p><p id="""">To ensure that you are getting an energy efficient appliance, it’s important to understand the Energy Factor (EF) rating. This rating is given to how much energy your water heater uses compared to how much hot water it produces. The higher the EF number, the more energy efficient your new water heater will be.</p><p id="""">Another standard worth researching is the Thermal Efficiency (TE) rating. This rate measures the amount of heat transferred from the combustion source to heat up the water in your home. A higher TE rating means that you are using less energy to heat up your hot water, which is great news for your wallet!</p>",,,Water Heater Replacement | Brandenburg Plumbing

You're not alone. Millions of people around the world struggle with this issue on a daily basis.</p><p id="""">But what causes low water pressure in the first place? Well, there are several possible reasons. It could be a problem with your municipal water system, or it could be that your home's plumbing isn't up to par. It could also be that there's something blocking the water flow, such as sediment or a lodged object.</p><p id="""">No matter what the cause, there are easy solutions that you can try yourself before calling in a professional. In this article, we'll cover some of the most common causes of low water pressure and provide you with some easy solutions to try.</p><h4 id="""">What to Do if You Have Low Water Pressure</h4><p id="""">If you have low water pressure, it might seem like a minor inconvenience. But, over time, this can lead to greater problems—such as an inability to get the water pressure you need for tasks like cleaning your car or watering your lawn.</p><p id="""">Fortunately, there are some easy solutions you can try. The first is to check your faucet for any debris or food particles that might be blocking the flow of water. You can also check to see if your aerator is clogged. This is the part of the faucet that increases the water pressure.</p><p id="""">If those solutions don't work, you might need to call a plumber. Low water pressure can be caused by a variety of issues, such as a clogged pipe or a leak in your home's plumbing system.</p><h4 id="""">Installing a Water Pressure Booster Pump</h4><p id="""">If your water pressure is consistently low, you might want to consider installing a water pressure booster pump. This is a small, fairly easy-to-install pump that will increase the water pressure in your home.</p><p id="""">It's important to note that a water pressure booster pump is not a permanent solution to low water pressure. It's simply a way to give you more consistent pressure in the short term. If you're experiencing low water pressure for an extended period of time, you'll likely need to have your pipes looked at by a professional.</p><p id="""">But if you're looking for a quick and easy way to boost your water pressure, a water pressure booster pump is the way to go.</p><h4 id="""">Identifying Plumbing Problems That Can Cause Low Water Pressure</h4><p id="""">Have you tried to identify any plumbing problems that could be contributing to your low water pressure? If you have a blocked pipe, it can reduce the pressure of the water coming out of a shower head, faucet, or even your outdoor hose. A leaky pipe is another issue that can cause low water pressure.</p><p id="""">Here’s one easy way to figure out if you have a blocked pipe or a leaky one: measure the water flow in each outlet in your house. If the flow rate is consistently lower than normal, then you probably have a blockage somewhere. To find it, turn on all of your taps and check for unusual sounds like hissing or bubbling. That could mean that there’s a leak somewhere in the line. You should also check for any unusual changes in your water bill as well—that could also signal that there’s an issue with your plumbing.</p><h4 id="""">Repairing or Replacing Fixtures and Pipes</h4><p id="""">Are the fixtures or pipes in your home older? If so, they may be the cause of your low water pressure. To find out if this is the case, you’ll want to inspect them for any leaks, cracks, or blockages.</p><p id="""">In some cases, you may be able to do a quick repair with new gaskets or washers; however, if the issue is more extensive it may require replacing the whole fixture or pipe. It's also likely that your pipes could simply be too small for the area they serve, in that case you are going to need to replace them with larger pipes.</p><p id="""">It’s important to note here that bigger doesn't always equal better — depending on your specific plumbing system and water pressure demands, too large of a pipe can actually cause an undesirable drop in water pressure. So it's best to consult a professional if you're not sure what size piping you should use.</p><h4 id="""">Home Maintenance Tips for Avoiding Low Water Pressure</h4><p id="""">If you want to try and prevent low water pressure from happening in the first place, here are some tips:</p><p id="""">- Check all the fixtures in your home for any signs of leaking. Leaks can reduce the amount of water available to other fixtures.</p><p id="""">- Clean out the aerators on all your faucets and showerheads. Sometimes, these can get clogged with mineral buildup, reducing water flow.</p><p id="""">- Make sure that your water heater is not set too high. If it's too hot, it will make your pipes contract and decrease water pressure.</p><p id="""">- Finally, if you have old piping that hasn't been replaced in a while, it might be a good idea to replace them. Old pipes can corrode over time, which will also reduce your water pressure.</p>",,,Low Water Pressure | Brandenburg Plumbing

It is an essential part of any kitchen, as it helps reduce the amount of food waste that is thrown away each week.</p><p id="""">Not only does a garbage disposal help to keep your kitchen smelling fresh, but it also helps to prevent clogs. The grinding action of the disposal liquefies the food scraps, which means they are less likely to cause a clog in your plumbing.</p><p id="""">If you want to keep your garbage disposal in good working order, it is important to operate it with cold water. Hot water can cause the metal parts to rust, and this will shorten the lifespan of your disposal.</p><h4 id="""">Steps to Prevent Clogs</h4><p id="""">In order to prevent a clog, you'll want to run your disposal regularly with cold water. This will help break down any food waste and keep things moving along.</p><p id="""">You should also try to cut your waste into smaller pieces before sending it down the drain. This will help avoid any large chunks that could potentially cause a clog.</p><h4 id="""">What to Put in Your Garbage Disposal</h4><p id="""">You can put a lot of things down your garbage disposal—but that doesn't mean you should. We recommend using plenty of cold water while disposing any type of food. This helps the grinding process and keeps your disposal smelling fresh.</p><p id="""">Another word of caution: avoid hard, fibrous foods. These can get caught in the blades and cause problems. Potato skins, apple cores and celery are all examples of things that are best avoided.</p><p id="""">Finally, it's important to clean your disposal regularly. This prevents bacteria and mold from growing, which can lead to unpleasant odors. Use a disinfectant or a mixture of vinegar and baking soda to clean the inside of your disposal.</p><h4 id="""">How to Clean Your Garbage Disposal</h4><p id="""">If you have a stinky garbage disposal, then your first step is to give it a good clean. Here’s how:</p><p id="""">- Sprinkle some baking soda in the drain, followed by a healthy dose of white vinegar. The vinegar and baking soda combination will help to break down any stuck on gunk in the disposal and leave it smelling fresh. If you don’t have baking soda, you can use chopped citrus peels as an alternative.</p><p id="""">- Let the mixture sit for 20 minutes, then flush with boiling water. This will allow the mixture to work its magic and get rid of any odors.</p><p id="""">- Once the mixture has had time to work, use an old toothbrush or other scrubbing tool to remove any gunk from the blades or walls of your garbage disposal, then rinse with hot water again.</p><p id="""">Finally, add a squirt of dishwashing liquid and run the garbage disposal for about 10 seconds to make sure everything is cleaned properly. This cleaning routine will help keep your garbage disposal odor-free and running perfectly!</p><h4 id="""">Tips for Keeping Your Garbage Disposal Smelling Fresh</h4><p id="""">An easy but often overlooked tip is to clean the outside of your garbage disposal. Make sure to cut the power and then brush away any food particles that have collected on the outside of it. This will help keep it odor-free from the start.</p><p id="""">You can also use baking soda, vinegar and hot water to kill bacteria and germs. Start by pouring one cup of baking soda down the drain, followed by a cup of white vinegar and a half cup of hot water. The combination will cause the baking soda to foam up and, after 15 minutes or so, all of that should be rinsed away with hot water.</p><p id="""">And if you’re looking for an easy way to freshen up your disposal? Try adding some ice cubes and salt and grinding them together. The ice helps remove any stuck-on debris while the salt adds a nice fresh scent.</p><h4 id="""">Troubleshooting Common Garbage Disposal Problems</h4><p id="""">You’ve been doing all the right things, but you’re still experiencing issues with your garbage disposal. Not to worry—it happens. Let’s take a look at some of the more common problems and how to prevent them from happening in the first place.</p><p id="""">If your garbage disposal won’t turn on, it could be that you’ve just tripped a circuit breaker or fuse. To fix this, press the reset button on your garbage disposal unit or reset the circuit breaker or fuse box. You should also check for any jammed objects.</p><p id="""">If your garbage disposal is running but still emitting an odor, grind up some ice cubes and citrus peels to help sanitize it and get rid of any built-up food particles. Make sure you’re using cold water when running the disposal as well—hot water can melt fat and grease into your drainage system, causing clogs and further odor issues.</p>",,,Garbage Disposal Maintenance and Fixes | Brandenburg Plumbing

Here are six reasons to make the switch:</p><p id="""">1. Tankless water heaters are more efficient than traditional water heaters.</p><p id="""">2. They take up less space, so they're a good option for small homes or apartments.</p><p id="""">3. Tankless water heaters provide an endless supply of hot water, which is perfect for large families or homes with multiple bathrooms.</p><p id="""">4. They're environmentally friendly, because they don't waste energy by heating water that's not being used.</p><p id="""">5. Tankless water heaters last longer than traditional water heaters.</p><p id="""">6. They're more affordable in the long run, because they use less energy and don't require regular tank maintenance.</p><h4 id="""">Endless Hot Water on Demand</h4><p id="""">Say goodbye to cold showers and running out of hot water! Tankless water heaters provide an endless supply of hot water on demand, which is perfect for large families or households with multiple showers. You'll never have to worry about running out of hot water again.</p><p id="""">In addition, tankless water heaters are more efficient than traditional water heaters, meaning you'll save money on your energy bills. Plus, they take up less space, so they're a great option for small homes or apartments.</p><h4 id="""">Up to 40% Savings on Energy Bills</h4><p id="""">When you switch to a tankless water heater, you could see savings of up to 40% on your energy bills. How does that compare to a traditional tank-style heater? Well, a traditional water heater runs constantly, whether you're using hot water or not. That's because it has to maintain a set temperature so that you have hot water when you need it.</p><p id="""">A tankless water heater only heats water when you need it, so you're not wasting energy keeping the tank warm all the time. In fact, a lot of tankless heaters are energy-efficient enough to qualify for tax credits or rebates. So not only will you be saving money on your energy bill each month, but you may also get a little money back in return.</p><h4 id="""">Longer Life Expectancy Compared to Traditional Storage Tanks</h4><p id="""">Switching to a tankless water heater could be the best decision you make for your home and wallet. Why? Tankless water heaters last up to twice as long on average than traditional storage tanks. So, if you’re looking for a long-term solution (and who isn’t?) tankless is the way to go.</p><p id="""">Better yet, tankless water heaters are designed with several layers of protection against rust and corrosion that help extend its life expectancy even longer, saving you from replacements and repairs that quickly add up when it comes to traditional storage tanks.</p><p id="""">Plus, with most tankless water heaters coming with warranties of 10 or more years—versus the traditional 5-7 year warranty on traditional storage tanks—you have peace of mind knowing you are making a smart investment.</p><h4 id="""">Compact Size and Increased Safety</h4><p id="""">The fifth great reason to switch to a tankless water heater is that they are much more compact and can be installed in even the most cramped of spaces. This makes them great for installing in tight spaces in homes, garages or other places. Plus, since tankless water heaters don’t use as much energy and don’t require as much space, you won’t have to worry about safety issues with gas leakage or fires. Because of their built-in safety features and overall smaller size, you can rest easy knowing that your investment will be dependable for many years to come with Brandenburg Plumbing.</p><h4 id="""">Professional Installation From Brandenburg Plumbing</h4><p id="""">When it comes to switching to a tankless water heater, you don’t want to do the installation yourself.

Here is how to do it.,"<h4 id="""">Identifying the Clog</h4><p id="""">There are a few telltale signs that you have a clog in your drain. You might see water backing up and spilling out of the drain, or maybe your sink is taking forever to drain. If you suspect that you have a clog, it's best to take care of it as soon as possible.</p><p id="""">The best way to identify the clog is to pour a pot of boiling water down the drain. If the boiling water makes its way through the clog, then you know it's located in that specific spot. If the boiling water doesn't work, then it's likely that the clog is further down the line and will require more drastic measures.</p><h4 id="""">DIY Solutions for Drain Blockages</h4><p id="""">You don't need to call in a professional to clear a clogged drain. There are plenty of simple solutions you can try at home first.</p><p id="""">One common method is to pour a pot of boiling water down the drain. The heat will help to break up the clog. You can also try using a plunger to dislodge the blockage. And if that doesn't work, there are plenty of chemical drain cleaners available at your local hardware store.</p><p id="""">Just be sure to read the instructions carefully and always use caution when working with chemicals. And if the clog is still stubborn, it might be time to call in the professionals.</p><h4 id="""">Professional Drain Cleaning Tips</h4><p id="""">You may think that you can take care of clogged drains yourself, but sometimes it's best to call in a professional. Here are a few tips from the experts on how to clear those pesky clogs:</p><p id="""">1. Use a plunger. If the clog is near the surface, a plunger may be able to dislodge it. Push and pull the plunger up and down vigorously until the clog is gone.</p><p id="""">2. Pour hot vinegar down the drain. This will help break up the clog. Allow the vinegar to sit in the drain for 30 minutes before rinsing with hot water.</p><p id="""">3. Use a wire hanger to dislodge the clog. Straighten out a wire hanger and slowly push it down the drain until you feel or see the clog. Twist and turn the hanger until the clog is dislodged.</p><p id="""">4. Call a professional. If none of these tips work, it's time to call in a professional drain cleaner. They have special tools and techniques to clear even the most stubborn clogs.</p><h4 id="""">Home Remedies to Unclog a Drain</h4><p id="""">If you're looking for cheaper options to unclog your drains, there are some simple home remedies that can do the trick. For instance, if the clog is near the drain opening, you can try boiling water, baking soda and vinegar, or a plunger.</p><p id="""">The boiling water method is fairly simple. Just boil a few cups of water and pour it straight down the drain slowly. This should be able to remove some of the grime and congestion.</p><p id="""">You can also mix baking soda and vinegar together and pour it into your drain. The combination of these two ingredients creates a fizzy reaction which should dissolve whatever grime may be causing the clog.</p><p id="""">For a quick solution, you can use a plunger to loosen or dislodge any clogs that may have formed near the opening of the drain. Cover the overflow drain if there is one for best results, then pump up and down vigorously until you feel resistance from whatever is blocking your pipes.</p><h4 id="""">Common Causes of Clogged Drains</h4><p id="""">It’s useful to be aware of the common causes of a clogged drain so that you can take steps to prevent them from happening in the first place. To start off, food waste should never be placed down your drain, as this will build up over time and create clogs. Hair is another major culprit—particularly when you have showers with poor-quality screens or no screen at all. Additionally, grease should also be kept away from your drain, as it can solidify and adhere to your pipes, forming a sticky blockage.</p><p id="""">The best way to avoid any future clogs is to keep an eye on what goes down your drains. So don’t let anything other than water pass through! And if you see signs of a potential problem, use these tips or get help from a professional sooner rather than later—it can make all the difference.</p><h4 id="""">Prolonging Drain Life With Maintenance</h4><p id="""">One of the most effective ways to keep your drains clog-free is with periodic maintenance. A drain snake is one of the best tools to have in your arsenal. You can insert it down the drain and then twist it around to try to remove any blockages.</p><p id="""">If all else fails, you may need to use a professional cleaning product designed to dissolve grease, hair, and other debris that accumulates over time. Make sure to use an all natural product without harsh chemicals as they can damage your pipes and even corrode certain metals.</p><p id="""">During this process, you should also inspect your pipes for any signs of wear or structural damage. Depending on what material your pipes are made from, you may want to consider replacing them if they’re too far gone. Doing so will help reduce future clogs and prolong the life of your drains and other plumbing fixtures.</p>",,,Clearing Clogged Drains | Brandenburg Plumbing

It’s incredibly hard, and when it’s not city water, it often contains harmful contaminants. Luckily, there are solutions, falling into three main categories:</p><ol id=""""><li id="""">Water Softeners</li><li id="""">Reverse Osmosis</li><li id="""">Whole House Filters</li></ol><p id=""""><br>So, let’s dive into these three options and a few things to consider for each. </p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Water Softeners</strong></h4><p id="""">1. Softer Hair, Skin, and Clothing</p><p id="""">Hard water strips the body of its natural oils, leaving dry, brittle skin and hair instead. Showering in hard water leaves an insoluble, sticky soap scum film on your body, so what may feel “clean” is actually much less. </p><p id="""">2. More Effective Cleaning Products</p><p id="""">Hard water contains calcium and magnesium ions, which makes it difficult for most modern cleaning products, including laundry detergent, auto cleaners, dishwasher soap, and more, to adequately lather and attach to whatever needs cleaning. With soft water, use less cleaning products more effectively.</p><p id="""">3. Hard Water is Expensive</p><p id="""">Mineral scale will fill your water heater, shower head, faucets, and more, &nbsp;decreasing efficiency across your entire home system. Hard water buildup will also cause increased wear and tear on all your piping, fixtures, and appliances, meaning faster breakages and more difficult, costlier repairs.</p><p id="""">4. Required for Reverse Osmosis Systems</p><p id="""">If you are using well water, it’s likely that you need a Reverse Osmosis drinking water system to remove harmful contaminants. The catch? RO systems require soft water, so having one already installed makes the switch much easier.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Whole House Filters</strong></h4><p id="""">1. Clean Water for the Entire Home</p><p id="""">Whole house water filtration systems are hooked up directly to your home’s main water supply. From there, they filter out contaminants, and filtered water is then sent through your home’s pipes to feed into your faucets, showerheads, toilets, and appliances. </p><p id="""">Unlike reverse osmosis filters that typically only clean small amounts of water at a time for drinking, whole house water filter systems filter every drop of water in your home. </p><p id="""">2. Cost Savings</p><p id="""">By eliminating contaminants, whole house water filters can extend the life of your home’s pipes and water-using appliances. And if your family buys bottled water, then a whole house water filtration system can save you hundreds of dollars annually.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Next Steps + Brands</strong></h4><p id="""">Request a free, no obligation water test and estimate, and Brandenburg plumbing would be happy to test your water for hardness and contaminants and provide a free quote.</p><p id="""">Brandenburg Plumbing services all brands, and recommends the following for new installations:</p><p id="""">Water Softeners - Clack WS1 Heads</p><p id="""">Reverse Osmosis Systems - Watts Kwik Change 4-stage RO</p><p id="""">Whole House Water Filters - Boshart 10” filters (carbon and/or sediment)</p><p>‍</p>",,,The 3 Main Types of Water Treatment

Read on to see these myths dispelled and more.,"<p id="""">We feel bad for water softeners — their reputation isn’t nearly as great as it should be. And while aren’t sure how water softeners have gotten such a bad rap, we’d like to come to their defense and dispel a few of the most common myths we hear our customers repeat.<br></p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Myth 1: Water Softeners Remove Essential Minerals</strong></h4><p id="""">One prevalent misconception is that water softeners strip water of essential minerals, jeopardizing its nutritional value. The truth is that water softeners primarily target calcium and magnesium ions responsible for water hardness. They do not remove essential minerals like potassium and sodium. If anything, the softened water might taste better due to the absence of the metallic undertones associated with hard water.<br></p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Myth 2: Softened Water is Unsafe to Drink</strong></h4><p id="""">Some believe that water softened through ion exchange might introduce harmful substances. However, the ion exchange process merely replaces hardness minerals with sodium ions, posing no health risks. Softened water is entirely safe for consumption, and many people prefer its improved taste and texture.<br></p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Myth 3: Water Softeners Consume Excessive Water</strong></h4><p id="""">Modern water softeners are designed to be water-efficient, using only a fraction of water compared to older models. Some advanced systems even feature smart regeneration technology, optimizing water usage.<br></p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Myth 4: Water Softeners Require High Maintenance</strong></h4><p id="""">In reality, routine maintenance for most water softeners involves adding salt and periodic checks of the system settings. Regular upkeep ensures optimal performance, but it's not an arduous task.<br></p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Myth 5: Softened Water Feels Slippery</strong></h4><p id="""">A common misconception is that softened water leaves a slippery feeling on the skin. This sensation is in reality attributed to the reduced formation of soap scum. Softened water allows soap to lather more efficiently, leading to a smoother feel during rinsing. The water itself does not create the slippery sensation; it's the positive side effect of reduced mineral buildup. You will retain your natural oils and minerals that are actually cleaner and healthier for your skin. The feeling after a hard water shower or bath is actually dry, brittle skin, not the feeling of natural cleanliness.<br></p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Myth 6: Water Softeners are Harmful to Plants</strong></h4><p id="""">The thinking goes that water softeners either remove minerals helpful to your outdoor plants, or that the plants are somehow adversely affected by soft water. The easiest way to refute this myth? Think of rainwater, which has been the water source for plants way before irrigation systems ever existed. Rainwater is the softest water possible, so why would soft water suddenly be harmful?</p>",,,Top 6 Water Softener Myths

Here are the top causes and what you can do about it. ,"<h4 id="""">Common Causes of Leaking Faucets</h4><p id="""">There are several common causes of a leaking faucet. One possibility is that the washer is old and needs to be replaced. Another reason could be that the valve seat is worn down, or that the o-ring is no longer in good condition.</p><p id="""">If your faucet is leaking, it's important to determine the root cause and take corrective action as soon as possible. A leaking faucet can waste water and increase your monthly utility bill. It can also damage your faucet and plumbing fixtures, leading to more expensive repairs down the road.</p><p id="""">If you're not sure what's causing your leaking faucet, it's best to call a professional for assistance. They will be able to identify the problem and recommend the best course of action for fixing it.</p><h4 id="""">Troubleshooting Solutions</h4><p id="""">There are a few troubleshooting solutions you can try when your faucet is leaking.</p><p id="""">The first is to replace the washer. This is the most common solution for a leaking faucet, and it's a quick and easy fix. All you need to do is twist off the aerator, remove the old washer, and pop in the new one. Make sure you get the right size washer for your faucet, or you could end up with the same problem down the road.</p><p id="""">If replacing the washer doesn't fix the problem, you may need to replace the entire faucet. This can be a more expensive fix, but it's something you may have to do if the faucet is old or corroded.</p><p id="""">Finally, if neither of those solutions works, it may be time to call in a plumber. A leaking faucet can be a sign of a bigger problem, so it's best to get it fixed before it becomes a bigger issue.</p><h4 id="""">How to Identify and Repair Washers, O-Rings, and Seals</h4><p id="""">There are a few different causes of a leaking faucet, but the most common ones are due to worn washers, o-rings, or seals. If you suspect that one of these is the culprit, there are a few things you can do to try to fix it.</p><p id="""">The first step is to identify which part is causing the problem. To do this, you'll need to remove the handle from the faucet. Once you have it off, take a look at the washers, o-rings, and seals and see if any of them look worn or damaged.</p><p id="""">If you do find a worn part, you can try replacing it yourself. You can usually find replacement parts at your local hardware store. If you're not comfortable doing it yourself, you can always call a plumber for help.</p><h4 id="""">Common Parts That Fail in Faucets</h4><p id="""">Now let's delve into the common parts that tend to fail in faucets. The most common culprits are the O-ring or the washer. The O-ring, usually made of rubber, is located at the base of the valve stem and is responsible for keeping water from leaking out. On the other hand, the washer is a metal disk located at the head of the valve stem that acts as a stopper for water and also helps regulate pressure.</p><p id="""">When either one of these components start to wear out, you might notice your faucet isn't shutting off completely after use, or there may be a slow drip coming from your faucet. Both of these can cause an annoying and wasteful leak in your home—not to mention it will increase your water bills over time.</p><p id="""">Luckily, replacing either of these components is a relatively simple process that you can do yourself if you have a few tools around. But if that sounds like too much work, don't forget that you can always call in a professional plumber to get it done right away.</p><h4 id="""">Causes of Hard Water Buildup</h4><p id="""">Hard water can be a major culprit when it comes to leaky faucets. The minerals in hard water, like calcium and magnesium, can react with metal and plastic parts inside the faucet to form deposits that could decrease water pressure. This build up is called “scale” and can cause a few different problems.</p><p id="""">If the scale builds up around the valve seat — where the faucet handle connects — it might prevent the valve from properly shutting off, causing a constant drip. Even if you shut off your faucet tightly, over time, this scale buildup will continue to increase until you have a noticeable leak coming from the tap.</p><p id="""">Certain parts of the country with hard water are more prone to this type of problem than others—so if you live in an area known for its hard water, it might be worth checking your taps regularly to make sure they’re not leaking due to scale buildup.</p><h4 id="""">When to Call a Plumber for Help</h4><p id="""">If you’ve tried all the above options and your faucet is still leaking, then it’s time to call in the professionals. A good plumber should be able to diagnose and fix the underlying issues quickly without too much fuss.</p><p id="""">But it’s important to do your research first before calling a plumber and make sure you get one with a good reputation. You can ask friends and family for recommendations, or read reviews online for a better idea of who can help.</p><p id="""">Once you have the plumber onsite, let them know exactly what’s wrong and give them access to all the parts that need replacing. This will help them figure out what needs to be done faster and with less effort. And at the end of it, you should be left with a fixed faucet that won’t leak again anytime soon!</p><h4 id="""">Conclusion</h4><p id="""">If you're dealing with a leaky faucet, it's important to identify the cause so you can fix it. Here are the most common causes of leaking faucets, and what you can do to address them.</p><p id="""">If your faucet is leaking because the seal is bad, you can replace the seal to fix the problem. If your faucet is leaking because the valve is worn out, you can replace the valve to fix the problem. If your faucet is leaking because the hose is cracked, you can replace the hose to fix the problem. If your faucet is leaking because the washer is worn out, you can replace the washer to fix the problem. If your faucet is leaking because the handle is loose, you can tighten the handle to fix the problem.</p>",,,Diagnosing a Leaky Faucet | Brandenburg Plumbing

Filtered water simply tastes better, and because it's free from contaminants, it doesn't have that ""off"" taste that can sometimes be unpleasant.</p><p id="""">3. Savings on your utility bills – another great benefit of filtered water is that it can help reduce your monthly utility bills. By drinking and bathing in filtered water, you're not using as much energy or heating up as much water, so you'll see a reduction in your monthly bills.</p><h4 id="""">How Does Water Filtration Actually Work?</h4><p id="""">There are a lot of factors that go into water filtration, but it basically comes down to removing impurities from the water. This can be done in a variety of ways, such as by using a filter, reverse osmosis or distillation.</p><p id="""">The important thing to remember is that all of these methods work differently, so you need to find the one that's best for your needs. For example, if you're looking for a filter to remove chlorine from your water, you'll need one that's specifically designed for that purpose.</p><p id="""">Likewise, if you're looking to filter out heavy metals or other contaminants, you'll need to choose a filter that's suited for those specific needs. And if you're on a tight budget, you may want to consider a reverse osmosis system, which is more affordable than distillation but still removes impurities from the water.</p><h4 id="""">What Should I Look for When Choosing a Water Filter?</h4><p id="""">When you’re ready to invest in water filtration, there are a few things to keep in mind:</p><p id="""">- Check out different types of water filtration systems. Whether you’re shopping for an under-counter or whole house solution, think about what type of system will fit your needs and budget.</p><p id="""">- Look for filtration systems certified by NSF International, a non-profit organization that sets standards for water filters and certifies products that meet their criteria.</p><p id="""">- Pay attention to the size of the filter(s). This will determine how often you would need to maintain or replace them.</p><p id="""">- Check the gallon capacity of the filter system and look for one with a higher capacity, as it’ll last longer between replacements.</p><p id="""">- Ensure the filter is backed by a good warranty and customer service options so if something goes wrong, you can get help quickly.</p><p id="""">By considering these factors when looking into water filtration systems, you can be sure to be making an informed decision when investing in one that best suits your lifestyle and needs.</p><h4 id="""">What Are the Different Types of Water Filtration Systems?</h4><p id="""">The type of water filtration system you choose will depend on your individual needs, but there are a few main categories to consider.</p><p id="""">- Point-of-Entry Systems filter water at the source—before it enters your home—and are usually installed in the basement or outside your home. These are best for homes with high levels of contaminants, as they can effectively remove chlorine, lead, and other heavy metals.</p><p id="""">- Point-of-Use systems filter water at the tap and are great for single-use applications like drinking and cooking. These systems range from pitcher filters to under-sink filters, so you can find a filtration system that works best for you and your family.</p><p id="""">- Whole House Filtration Systems combine both point of entry and point of use systems to provide clean filtered water throughout your entire house. This is an ideal choice if you live in an area with high levels of pollutants in the water or if you’re looking for an all-inclusive solution.</p><p id="""">No matter which type of filtration system you choose, investing in clean and safe drinking water is always a smart choice!</p><h4 id="""">Maintenance Tips for Water Filter Systems</h4><p id="""">When it comes to owning and maintaining a water filter system, it’s important to understand the basics of how it works and why you should invest in one. Here are some maintenance tips for your water filter system:</p><p id="""">- Test your system regularly to ensure optimal performance.</p><p id="""">- Replace the filter as soon as possible when it starts deteriorating or losing efficiency.</p><p id="""">- Clean the housing every few months or depending on usage, as this will help remove any sediment or buildup that might be present.</p><p id="""">- If you have an RO (reverse osmosis) system installed, make sure you’re performing regular maintenance on the membrane and check for any problems with the filters.</p><p id="""">- If you have a UV (ultraviolet light) filter, check periodically that the UV lamp is still intact and replace if necessary.</p><p id="""">By taking care of your water filter system, you’ll not only extend its lifecycle but also get peace of mind knowing that it's working properly and providing enough protection against contaminants in your drinking water.</p>",,,Why Water Filtration | Brandenburg Plumbing

In this article, we'll teach you about the causes of a leaky shower head and some potential solutions.</p><h4 id="""">What Causes a Shower Head to Leak?</h4><p id="""">There are a few things that can cause your shower head to leak. It could be that the washers are old and need to be replaced, or that the O-rings have deteriorated and need to be replaced as well. It could also be that the shower head is not installed properly, there's a crack in the shower head, or the water pressure is too high.</p><p id="""">If you think that it's one of these issues, you can try to fix it yourself. Replacing the washers or O-rings is a pretty simple task, and you can usually find instructions on how to do it on the manufacturer's website. If it's something more complicated, like a crack in the shower head, you may need to call a plumber to fix it for you.</p><p id="""">And if you think that it might be the water pressure, you can try lowering it using your home's water pressure regulator.</p><h4 id="""">How to Fix a Shower Head Leak</h4><p id="""">If your shower head is leaking, it's likely due to one of two reasons: a build-up of lime scale or a damaged washer.</p><p id="""">To fix the problem, you'll need to either remove the lime scale or replace the washer.</p><p id="""">Removing the lime scale is a relatively easy process. You can use vinegar or a descaling product to do this. Once you've removed the scale, you can then replace the washer, which is a more difficult task and may require the help of a professional.</p><h4 id="""">Different Types of Seals and Washers</h4><p id="""">Your shower head might be leaking because of one of two reasons: a worn-out seal or a defective washer. Let's take a look at the different types of seals and washers and see which one might be causing your problem.</p><p id="""">The O-ring is the most common type of seal, and it's usually made of rubber or silicone. It's located on the threads of the shower head and is responsible for creating a watertight seal. If this seal is worn out, it can cause leaks.</p><p id="""">The second type of seal is the gasket. This is a ring-shaped piece of rubber or plastic that sits between the shower head and the pipe. It helps to keep water from leaking out around the threads. If your shower head leaks, it's possible that your gasket is damaged or missing.</p><p id="""">The third type of seal is the washer. This is a small, round piece of rubber or plastic that sits in the bottom of the shower head housing. It creates a watertight seal between the housing and the pipe. If your shower head leaks, it's possible that your washer is damaged or missing.</p><h4 id="""">How to Clean and Replace a Shower Head</h4><p id="""">If cleaning the shower head does not fix the issue, you might need to replace it. Fortunately, replacing a shower head is fairly easy and only requires a few basic tools.</p><p id="""">Start by turning off the water supply. You'll then need to unscrew the old shower head using a wrench or pliers, depending on its shape. After that, all you have to do is attach the new shower head in its place and turn the water supply back on.</p><p id="""">If you're having trouble loosening the old shower head, don't force it; try placing a damp cloth around it and leave it for a while before attempting to unscrew it again with pliers or a wrench. Placing a drop of lubricant such as WD-40 can also help loosen stuck parts. Once you've replaced your old shower head with a new one, your leaking problem should be gone!</p><h4 id="""">Troubleshooting Common Issues With Leaking Shower Heads</h4><p id="""">If you’ve tried the previous steps and still haven’t resolved your issue, it may be time to troubleshoot the more common causes of leaking shower heads.</p><p id="""">If your shower head is too loose on the pipe, it might be time to tighten the connection with some Teflon tape. Apply a few wraps of tape around the threads, being sure to cover them completely. That should do the trick!</p><p id="""">The next common issue is when limescale builds up inside the holes in your shower head and blocks water flow. This can be tricky to fix because you’ll need to get inside your shower head to unscrew any blockages. If this is the case, you’ll need to use a longer length of pipe wrench to unscrew and remove any clogged parts inside the head.</p><p id="""">You can also try immersing your showerhead in vinegar for a few hours, then scrubbing away any remaining limescale with an old toothbrush.</p><h4 id="""">What to Do if the Problem Persists</h4><p id="""">If after following all of the steps above your shower head is still leaking, then it’s time to take a deeper look. In this case, you’ll likely need to replace some parts or even the entire shower head.</p><p id="""">The parts that are most likely to be faulty and will need to be replaced are the washers and/or O-ring(s). These pieces help create a seal between both ends of the shower head, stopping water from coming out and causing damage. If they become warped, cracked or discolored over time due to regular wear and tear, they’re probably the culprits behind your leaky shower head.</p><p id="""">If you don't feel comfortable tackling the problem yourself, then I would suggest seeking assistance from a professional who can help you diagnose and fix the issue quickly.</p><h4 id="""">Conclusion</h4><p id="""">So, if your shower head is leaking, don’t panic! There are a few potential causes and solutions, and we’ve outlined them all in this article. We hope you find this information helpful and that it solves your shower head leakage problem.</p>",,,Leaking Shower Head Tips | Brandenburg Plumbing

Discover the best solutions for common plumbing issues in Burnet, TX, and keep your home's plumbing in top shape.","<h4 id="""">Understanding Drain Cleaning Tools: Which One Do You Need?</h4><p id="""">When it comes to maintaining a healthy plumbing system, drain cleaning is a task no homeowner can ignore. In Burnet, TX, where hard water and aging pipes can pose unique challenges, understanding the right tools for the job is essential. Let’s break down when to use a hand snake, closet auger, sewer machine, camera inspection, or hydrojetting.</p><h4 id="""">Hand Snake or Closet Auger: The DIY Heroes</h4><p id="""">If you’re dealing with a minor clog in your sink, shower, or toilet, a hand snake or closet auger might do the trick. These tools are ideal for:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Small clogs near the surface</strong>, such as hair or soap buildup in bathroom drains.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Single fixtures</strong>, like a slow-draining kitchen sink or a backed-up toilet.</li></ul><p id="""">A hand snake is flexible and can navigate tight curves in pipes, while a closet auger is specifically designed for toilets, with a protective tube to prevent scratching the porcelain.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">When to call a pro:</strong> If the clog persists despite your best efforts, it may be further down the line.</p><h4 id="""">Sewer Machine: Heavy-Duty Clog Buster</h4><p id="""">For more stubborn blockages, especially those deeper in your home’s plumbing system, a sewer machine (or power auger) steps in. This motorized tool is perfect for:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Tree root intrusions</strong>, a common issue in the Burnet area due to our mature landscapes.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Grease or solid debris</strong> lodged in main sewer lines.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Recurring clogs</strong> that keep coming back after using simpler tools.</li></ul><p id="""">A professional plumber will ensure the machine is used safely, avoiding potential damage to your pipes.</p><h4 id="""">Camera Inspection: Eyes Inside Your Pipes</h4><p id="""">Sometimes, the cause of a clog isn’t immediately obvious. That’s where a camera inspection comes in handy. This tool provides a real-time look inside your plumbing, making it possible to:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Identify the exact location and nature of the problem</strong>, such as cracks, sagging pipes, or severe blockages.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Assess pipe conditions</strong>, particularly useful for older homes in Burnet.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Prevent future issues</strong> by catching potential problems early.</li></ul><p id="""">This step often follows the initial unclogging process to confirm the drain is fully cleared.</p><h4 id="""">Hydrojetting: The Power Washer for Your Pipes</h4><p id="""">For the toughest clogs or when your pipes need a thorough cleaning, hydrojetting is the go-to solution. This method uses high-pressure water to:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Blast away grease, sludge, and scale buildup</strong> that accumulates over time.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Clear tree roots and other stubborn debris</strong> that mechanical tools might miss.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Restore pipe diameter</strong>, improving water flow and preventing future clogs.</li></ul><p id="""">Hydrojetting is especially beneficial in areas like Burnet, where mineral deposits from hard water can quickly narrow your pipes.</p>",Fri Jul 11 2025 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),,Drain Cleaning Tools | Brandenburg Plumbing

Read on for the top ten items you should never flush.,"<h2 id="""">Introduction</h2><p id="""">You know not to flush things like tampons and diapers down the toilet. But what else shouldn't you flush? Here are the top 10 things you shouldn't flush down the toilet.</p><h4 id="""">Kitchen Grease and Fats</h4><p id="""">One of the most common items people flush down the toilet is kitchen grease and fats. But just like any other type of trash, it's important not to put these down the drain.</p><p id="""">Grease and fats will harden as they cool and can easily block your plumbing. This can cause some serious damage, not to mention a nasty mess. So if you're ever in doubt about what to do with kitchen grease, just remember: don't flush it!</p><h4 id="""">Feminine Hygiene Products</h4><p id="""">Don't flush your tampons! Believe it or not, they can cause some serious damage to your plumbing. Tampons are made of cotton and other materials that can easily get tangled up in sewer lines and pumps. Not to mention, they create a big mess for sanitation workers when they have to clean up after a blockage.</p><p id="""">Just think, if every woman followed this one rule, it would save the city millions of dollars in repairs every year. So please, do your part and toss your tampons in the trash can.</p><h4 id="""">Cotton Swabs and Plastic Cotton Buds</h4><p id="""">Cotton swabs and plastic cotton buds are two of the top items on our list of things you should never flush down the toilet.</p><p id="""">Why? For one, they can easily get clogged in your pipes. Second, they can create a mess and damage the environment. And finally, they can even be dangerous for your septic system.</p><p id="""">If you need to use a cotton swab or plastic cotton bud, try to stick to using them on external areas only. And please dispose of them properly—either in the trash or in a designated waste bin.</p><h4 id="""">Cigarette Butts</h4><p id="""">You know not to flush cigarettes, right? Cigarette butts don't dissolve like anything else down the toilet. And what's worse, they'll clog up your drainage system. Not to mention, cigarettes don't break down in the water ever.</p><p id="""">Pipes are already so small that they can get clogged up pretty easily; cigarette butts just make things worse. Even if you think that flushing the butt is a good way to dispose of it, it'll just travel further down the pipes and cause a massive problem at the end.</p><p id="""">So regardless of how convenient it may seem, try not to flush cigarettes. Don’t be tempted by this “quick fix” solution – after all, disposing of them in a non-flushable container is much easier and more manageable in the long run!</p><h4 id="""">Tissues, Paper Towels, Wet Wipes and Diapers</h4><p id="""">Let’s face it, we all like to have a good stash of tissues and paper towels on hand. They are great for cleaning up messes and blowing your nose. But please, whatever you do, don’t flush them down the toilet!</p><p id="""">Tissues and paper towels might feel soft and look like regular toilet paper, but they don’t dissolve in water like TP does, and can cause major blockages in your plumbing system. The same goes for wet wipes and diapers -- all three can get stuck to the walls of your pipes and cause a clog that will require costly repairs.</p><p id="""">So no matter how tempting it is to flush these items down the toilet, please just don't do it. Instead, you can throw them into your regular trash can or recycle bin, or even compost them if possible.</p><h4 id="""">Medications and Needles</h4><p id="""">Always make sure to properly dispose of medications and needles. These should never go down the toilet, since they can be hazardous to your health and the environment.</p><p id="""">In most cases, you can take old medications and other pharmaceutical items to a drug disposal site for safe disposal. Some pharmacies may also offer a drop-off option for medications that have been expired or no longer have an active ingredient.</p><p id="""">If you're unsure about what to do with old bras, needles, syringes or other medical devices, contact a local health department for guidance on safe disposal. Remember, it’s better to be safe than sorry!</p><h4 id="""">Nappies, Sanitary Napkins and Pads</h4><p id="""">You’ve probably heard this before, but just in case you haven’t: nappies, sanitary napkins, and pads should never be flushed down the toilet. That’s because these items are made to absorb liquid, and they can cause serious blockages in your pipes.</p><p id="""">Furthermore, they don’t break down quickly enough to move through the plumbing system without causing problems. If you throw them down the toilet, then they may end up clogging pipes and causing a backup, potentially damaging your plumbing and sewage system.</p><p id="""">On top of that, your water treatment process won't be able to filter out these materials properly; so it’s best to throw them in an appropriate waste bin. Remember: when it comes to these items, when in doubt—throw it out!</p><h4 id="""">Hair and Dental Floss</h4><p id="""">You may be surprised to learn that flushing hair down the toilet isn't a great idea. Even though it looks like they just dissolve and disappear, they'll just get stuck in the pipes and eventually cause blockages. The same goes for dental floss, too – it's best to throw these out in the trash instead of flushing them down your toilet.</p><p id="""">Speaking of hair, there are some really nasty things that can collect in your toilet drains if you're not careful. If you have long hair and don't clean your drain regularly, it’s possible that you might end up with a big clump of nasty stuff – soap scum, grease, food particles, dead skin cells – all sticking together with your hair! While you may think this won't cause much of a problem, in reality it can be very difficult to get rid of once it has built up. So if you want to avoid clogged drains and have shiny and clean plumbing lines, make sure you clean your drain regularly.</p><h4 id="""">Pet Waste</h4><p id="""">We can all agree that pet waste should remain in the litter box, not in the toilet. While it may seem harmless, flushing your pet’s waste is a big no-no. Not only do cat and dog poop contain bacteria that can lead to serious illnesses, but if this waste makes it way into the water supply, it can contaminate drinking water for an entire community.</p><p id="""">In addition to that, pet waste contains parasites like worms and tapeworms which can then spread to other animals or humans who come into contact with contaminated water. That’s why it’s important to keep both our pets and our waterways healthy by disposing of animal waste properly.</p><h4 id="""">Paint, Pesticides and Household Cleaners</h4><p id="""">Number 10 on our list of things not to flush are paint, pesticides and other household cleaners. We all know these products contain hazardous materials, but many of us still don’t realize that flushing them down the toilet is a big no-no!</p><p id="""">When paint and toxic cleaners are flushed down the toilet, they can end up in our rivers and other bodies of water where they can cause serious damage to the environment. These products can also wreak havoc on your septic or sewage system, as they contain chemicals that can destroy bacteria and cause blockages.</p><p id="""">The best way to dispose of these items is to take them to a local hazardous waste facility where they will be disposed of safely – never flush them down your toilet!</p><h4 id="""">Conclusion</h4><p id="""">So, now you know the top 10 things you should never flush down the toilet. As long as you remember these items, you'll be able to keep your plumbing in good condition and avoid any costly repairs. Remember, just because something is flushable, that doesn't mean it's supposed to be!</p>",,,Don't Flush These Items | Brandenburg Plumbing

Here are the next steps to take to diagnose the problem. ,"<h4 id="""">Check the Water Heater</h4><p id="""">The first thing you should do is check the water heater. If it's turned off or if the pilot light has gone out, it won't produce any heat. If it's not either of those things, then it's time to move on to step two.</p><h4 id="""">Test the Temperatures</h4><p id="""">Turn on the cold water and test it first. It should be running cold. If it's not, then you have a bigger problem on your hands and you should call a plumber.</p><p id="""">Next, turn on the hot water. It should be hot—but not scalding hot. If it's not, then the problem is likely with your water heater. Again, it's time to call a plumber.</p><h4 id="""">Check the Cold Water Intake Valve</h4><p id="""">If your hot water isn't working, the first step is to check the cold water intake valve. This is the valve that controls the flow of cold water into your home. It's located on the wall near your water meter.</p><p id="""">Make sure the valve is in the open position and that there is plenty of cold water running into your home. If there is, try resetting your water heater.</p><h4 id="""">Adjust the Temperature on Your Water Heater</h4><p id="""">The next thing you can do is adjust the temperature on your water heater. If it is set too low, it may not be heating the water enough to get it to your desired temperature. This can be easily adjusted by using a wrench to turn the small knob that is located on the side of your unit. Make sure to check the label for recommended settings and be careful not to exceed them, as this could cause damage to the unit or even create a safety hazard.</p><p id="""">If adjusting the temperature does not solve your problem, then there may be another issue such as a faulty thermostat or an element that needs replacing. In this case, you should contact a professional plumber for help. They will be able to diagnose the problem and make any necessary repairs quickly and efficiently.</p><h4 id="""">Examine Plumbing Connections for Leaks</h4><p id="""">The next step is to examine the connections on your hot water line. Look in the places where the pipes connect, like valves and faucets, and check for any signs of water leakage or loose connections. If you detect a leak, then this could be why you don’t have any hot water coming out—because it’s all leaking away!</p><p id="""">Fortunately, if the leak is minor, it shouldn't be too hard or expensive to fix. Start by tightening up any loose screws and bolts on the pipelines that you can see. You could also use plumber's tape to create a tighter seal around joints and on threaded pipes. Of course, for more complicated pipe leaks or major water damage, it's best to call in a plumbing professional for help.</p><h4 id="""">Call a Professional for Troubleshooting</h4><p id="""">If you’ve tried all of the above, and still no hot water, it’s time to call in a professional. There may be more serious issues that require special attention and expertise. For example, you may need to replace the heating element in your hot water heater or there may be a problem with your thermostat that requires an electrician or plumber to diagnose and fix.</p><p id="""">A professional plumber can also check for corrosion or calcium build-up on the inside of the tank that could be blocking the flow of heat to the water.

When it comes to plumbing upgrades, the decision can be overwhelming with an array of fixtures and technologies available in the market. However, one upgrade that stands out and offers multiple benefits is a water softener. </p><p id="""">If you're constantly battling with limescale buildup, constant repairs, dry skin, and lifeless laundry, it's likely that hard water is to blame, especially in our service area. Hard water contains high levels of minerals like calcium and magnesium, which can lead to these issues. This is where a water softener comes to the rescue.</p><h4 id="""">Protect Your Plumbing System</h4><p id="""">One of the most significant benefits of a water softener is that it can prolong the lifespan of your home's plumbing system. By reducing mineral buildup, water softeners help maintain the efficiency of your pipes and fixtures, saving you from costly repairs and replacements in the long run. </p><p id="""">Oftentimes the amount of scale found in the pipes and fixtures make repair impossible, requiring costly replacements or installs. </p><h4 id="""">Enhance Appliance Efficiency</h4><p id="""">As scale continues to accrete inside your dishwashers, washing machines, and water heaters, efficiency takes a major hit. We often open up water heaters to find half the tank filled with scale, majorly impacting the water heater's efficiency. </p><h4 id="""">Improve Skin and Hair Health</h4><p id="""">Hard water can strip the natural oils from your skin and hair, leaving them dry and itchy. A water softener can combat this problem, providing you with softer skin and shinier, more manageable hair. </p><h4 id="""">Economical and Eco-Friendly</h4><p id="""">Soft water requires less soap and detergent for cleaning purposes, which means you'll save on these household necessities. Not only does this make a water softener an economical choice, but it also reduces the amount of soap going down the drain and into the environment.</p><p id="""">In conclusion, a water softener is typically the #1 investment you can make into your home's plumbing, impacting every facet of your plumbing system, as well as your skin and hair. </p>",,,Why a Water Softener is the #1 Upgrade to Your Plumbing
